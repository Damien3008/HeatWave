# numerical-solution-of-the-heat-equation

During our mathematics classes, we had to solve the heat equation in one and two dimensions. I worked with two other students on it. In this file you can find two python codes, some video examples and a PDF. The PDF contains a theoretical approach of the heat equation and an analysis of the numerical schema from the point of view of its consistency, stability in the sense of Von Neumann-Fourier and convergence. Secondly, you can find two python codes: "Resolution_equation_heat" which contains a class "EqHeat" with a constructor and some methods, and "Resolution_equation_heat_main" which is the only code that you can edit in order to change the initial conditions. You can find some examples in it.
Finally, there are some videos of the heat equation in two dimensions with several initial conditions.
